## First Approach of docker


### Have you installed Docker ?

#### Linux

```
sudo apt install docker 
```

#### Mac 

Follow the [link](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-mac/install/)


#### Windows

2 choices :

* Use the Ubuntu WSL and follow the Linux commands (my preference)

* Follow the [link](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-windows/install/) to install docker on WIndows.





### First container 

SO let's check if the installation have worked correctly.

``` 
sudo docker run hello-world 
```

It should return the following results.

```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```

Congratulation you just ran your First (?) container image.
